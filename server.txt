 Test Your Dummy Payment Portal Locally
Run the server in the terminal:

bash

node server.js

Test the endpoints: You can use Postman or cURL to test the payment endpoint:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/pay -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": 500, "paymentMethod": "Credit Card"}'
This should return a payment success response:
json
Copy code
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Payment successful",
    "amount": 500
}


node server.js
If you send a request with an amount greater than 1000, it will return payment failure:
json
Copy code
{
    "success": false,
    "message": "Payment failed",
    "amount": 1500
}
